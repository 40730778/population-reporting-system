# Population Reporting System

## Overview
This project is a **Population Reporting System** developed as part of the **SET08103 Software Engineering Methods** module. It allows users to generate reports on populations of countries, cities, districts, and languages using an SQL database. The system is implemented in **Java 17**, packaged with Maven, and optionally can be run using **Docker**.

## Features
- Generate country, city, and capital city reports:
  - Sort by population (largest ‚Üí smallest)
  - Top N populated countries/cities/capitals
- Population statistics:
  - By continent, region, country, and district
  - People living in cities vs not living in cities (with percentages)
- Language statistics:
  - Number of people speaking Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic (with % of world population)
- Build and run with Maven or Docker

<!-- Prerequisites -->
- **Java 17**
- **Maven**
- Optional: **Docker**

## Build Instructions
### Using Maven
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/40730778/population-reporting-system.git
cd population-reporting-system
```
2. Build the project:
```bash
mvn clean package
```
3. The JAR file will be generated in:
target/population-reports-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.


### Docker
1.  Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t population-reports .
```
2. Run the Docker container:
```bash
docker run --rm population-reports
```

## Usage
Run the JAR file:
```bash
java -jar target/population-reports-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
Follow the prompts to generate reports by country, city, or language statistics.

## Current Features Implemented
- Country Report (feature/country-report)
- City Report (feature/city-report)
- Language Statistics (feature/language-stats)
- Population Statistics

## üß© Branching Strategy

The project follows the **Git Flow** branching model:

| Branch | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| `master` | Stable integration branch |
| `feature/country-report` | Country population reports |
| `feature/city-report` | City population reports |
| `feature/capital-city-report` | Capital city reports |
| `feature/population-report` | Population analysis |
| `feature/language-stats-report` | Language-based population statistics |
| `feature/tests` | Unit and integration test development |

Each report was developed and tested in its own branch before merging into `master`.


## üß± Continuous Integration and Testing

All builds and tests are automatically verified through **GitHub Actions** using Maven.

### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
The workflow:
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up **JDK 17**
3. Builds the project with Maven
4. Runs all **JUnit 5 tests**
5. Builds the **Docker image**

This ensures every commit is tested for compilation, functionality, and integration.

### Test Coverage

| Test Type | Description | File |
|------------|--------------|------|
| **Unit Tests** | Validate service methods for each report type (Country, City, Capital City, etc.) | `CountryReportServiceTest.java`, `CityReportServiceTest.java`, etc. |
| **Integration Test** | Confirms database connectivity | `DatabaseIntegrationTest.java` |

All tests execute automatically in GitHub Actions.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Configuration

The application connects to the **MySQL `world` database** provided by the lecturer.

Connection settings are stored in `Database.java`:

```java
String host = "localhost";
String database = "world";
String user = "root";
String password = "root";
